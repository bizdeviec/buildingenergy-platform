Feature: The angular filter should parse numbers and strings
In order to have a table with formatted number
As a SEED user
I check the number and string filter

Scenario: Jasmine tests pass
    Given I go to the jasmine unit tests for the SEED
    When I look around
    Then I should see that the tests passed
